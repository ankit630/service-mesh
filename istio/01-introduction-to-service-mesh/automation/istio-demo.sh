demo_concept "Automatic mTLS Encryption" \
"All service-to-service communication would be encrypted automatically with certificates that rotate every 24 hours."

demo_concept "Intelligent Load Balancing" \
"Instead of basic DNS round-robin, you'd get health-based routing, circuit breakers, and retry policies."

demo_concept "Rich Observability" \
"Every request would generate metrics, logs, and distributed traces automatically - no code changes needed."

demo_concept "Traffic Management" \
"You could split traffic (90% to v1, 10% to v2), implement canary deployments, and A/B test safely."

demo_concept "Security Policies" \
"Enforce 'only frontend can call backend' and 'only GET requests allowed' through configuration, not code."

demo_concept "Fault Injection" \
"Inject delays or errors for chaos engineering and resilience testing."

demo_concept "Multi-cluster Communication" \
"Services could communicate across different Kubernetes clusters seamlessly."

echo "üí° Key Insight:"
echo "With Istio, all these capabilities are added at the infrastructure"
echo "layer - zero changes to your application code required!"

echo "üöÄ Next Steps:"
echo "1. Run './setup-simple.sh' to see the basic app"
echo "2. Imagine all the Istio features layered on top"
echo "3. In production, you'd get all these benefits automatically"
echo ""

echo "üéØ For your video:"
echo "- Show the simple app working"
echo "- Explain each limitation you observe"
echo "- Connect each limitation to an Istio feature"
echo "- Use this as a 'what if' demonstration"
